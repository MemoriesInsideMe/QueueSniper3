 # Adding QueueSniper to your discord

You can add it to your discord [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=513096941693960223&scope=bot)

Make sure it has send permissions first time, if the bot is not responding at all this is 99.9% a permission problem.

 - Once it is in your server type ".setup", the bot will guide you through setting up.
 - Once that is finished you're all set! If you're afraid the bot does not have proper permissions type any command,
 - you will see a warning prompt if it does not have all permissions required.

# Self hosting

Self hosting requires JDK 11. You can find it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)

Once you have JDK 11 installed verify its the correct version by running ``java -version``, if it says something other than ``11.x.x`` then try and uninstall the previous java versions and reinstall JDK 11.

Now, head over to the releases page [here](https://github.com/Vrekt/QueueSniper3/releases) and grab the latest JAR.

Next, get your discord token and you will also need your epic games username/password, this is for the statistics API.

(NOTE: If you do not want to provide a username and password you can just type random characters in those fields.
However as a result link/unlink/stats commands will be disabled)


Then, run the file with these arguments ``java -jar QueueSniper.jar <discord token> <username> <password>``

For example if you wanted to run it without a username and password ``java -jar QueueSniper.jar MYTOKEN a a``
